%Default settings for the ERA Toolbox

%This script will be read by the ERA Toolbox to define the default settings
%for analyzing and viewing data in the ERA Toolbox. Should the user want to
%change any default settings, the values below can be changed. Upon
%restarting the toolbox, these settings will be read. Comments are provided 
%for understanding each input.
%
%Note: These changes will be made to each era_defaults.m every time a new 
%version is downloaded. 
%
%Input
% No inputs required in the command line

%Output
% era_prefs - data structure containing
