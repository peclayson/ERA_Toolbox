# ERA Toolbox

The [ERP Reliability Analysis (ERA) Toolbox](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1UKHP_3qIh22OG) uses generalizability theory as a method for evaluating reliability of ERP data. Dependability estimates (generalizability-theory analog to reliability) can be computed for any number of groups or events. The influence of number of trials on dependability of measurements will also be determined, and a recommended cutoff for inclusion of ERP data will be provided based on the stability of measurement as the number of trials included in a single-subject average for a given group and event increases.

See the [User Manual](documentation/UserManual.pdf) or [wiki](https://github.com/peclayson/ERA_Toolbox/wiki) for more information about the ERA Toolbox.
